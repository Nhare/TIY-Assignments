<p><strong>First Day of School!</strong><br/>We were lucky to have Eric Dodds, a partner at The Iron Yard, in the house to talk to our students about our mission as an organization. It&#8217;s something that everyone who&#8217;s reading this should <a href="http://theironyard.com/" title="The Iron Yard Mission" target="_blank">read through</a>, but what I&#8217;d like to reiterate about Eric&#8217;s talk is our commitment to &#8220;<span>training the highest-quality developers in the world, <strong>both in skill and in character.</strong>" While we&#8217;re preparing our students to be professional programmers, we&#8217;re also helping to grow the tech community and foster good, global citizens. This isn&#8217;t just about 12 weeks in a class&#8212; this is about unleashing productive problem solvers with a view of programming as life-long study </span>into the world to make it a better place for everyone. </p>
