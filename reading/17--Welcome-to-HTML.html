I'm a scholar. I enjoy scholarly pursuits. Suddenly playing with yourself is a scholarly pursuit? <span>Don't call my escorts whores.</span> They're not gonna strip, right? I told them not to, but I can't guarantee their instincts won't kick in. It's so watery. And yet there's a smack of ham to it. Yeah, I invited her. You said you wanted to spend time some with her. You said I was being an Ann hog. You've been warned about touching. You said spanking. I'M A MONSTER!!

<span>In prison, you just have to close your eyes and take it, but here you have to close your eyes and give it.</span> I'M A MONSTER!! Well, OK, have sex with this girl. Right now. Get in there, have some sex with her. Tobias Fünke costume. Either I zip down, or he zips up, and that is a mighty long zipper on Mother's Cher jumpsuit. Oh, yeah. The guy in the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in three months. COME ON! How about a turtle? I've always loved those leathery little snappy faces. No. I was ashamed to be _seen_ with you. I like being with you.

Say something that will terrify me. Lindsay: F*** me. Tobias: No, that didn't do it. They don't appreciate him. It's his glasses… they make him look like a lizard. Plus he's self-conscious. I'm a complete failure. <span>I can't even fake the death of a stripper.</span> If mother sees this, she will blow a cow.
