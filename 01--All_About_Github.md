My family enjoys scuba-diving. Nearly every school vacation we go on a remarkable diving trip. We have noticed that there are three very different types of divers. We refer to them as the "nature lovers", the "pool guys", and the "seals". Those whom we call "nature lovers" enjoy getting in the water for a short swim to look at the rocks, vegetation and sea creatures. The "pool guys", who don the latest hi-tech equipment, come for a short while to have a swim and test how well their new toys perform. The "seals", wearing only their swimsuits, disappear for whats seem like hours. Each of these divers enjoys the ocean in a different way.

The "nature lovers" are the ones who enjoy snorkeling around for brief periods of time. They always try not to hamper with the environment. Trash is always taken care of and they do not remove shells or anything else from the ecosystem. Adventuring to experience, but not spoil, the beauty of nature under the sea.

The "pool guys" are the divers who want to go to the beach, or ocean without ever actually leaving their backyard. They come in SUVs loaded to the brim. Wearing heavy-duty wet suits while carrying the latest in diving masks, fins, and air tanks. Seemingly so covered with equipment they can hardly see, feel, and touch the underwater environment. Comparing air tanks and wet suits is their strong suit.

The "seals" act as if they are returning back to their natural habitat. Perhaps in a "previous life" they were actually seals. Diving into the water without so much as a splash, poking around looking for crabs and other sea life. They are also the people who cook out on the beach. Using wood from around the beach or that had washed ashore for their fires, and food freshly caught from the sea!

My family are a combination of all three types. All my brother wants to do are try out different kinds of equipment and see how deep he can dive. As for my father, he is a "seal": swimming around and cooking his 'catch' are what he enjoy most. My mother and I are "nature lovers": swimming with snorkels and fins is fun, but neither of us have any interest in diving fifty feet down or reaching under a rock to find a slimy abalone. So, we all enjoy our diving trips in our own way.
