My family enjoys scuba-diving. Nearly every school vacation we go on a remarkable diving trip. We have noticed that there are three very different types of divers. We refer to them as the "nature lovers", the "pool guys", and the "seals". Those whom we call "nature lovers" enjoy getting in the water for a short swim to look at the rocks, vegetation and sea creatures. The "pool guys", who don the latest hi-tech equipment, come for a short while to have a swim and test how well their new toys perform. The "seals", wearing only their swimsuits, disappear for whats seem like hours. Each of these divers enjoys the ocean in a different way.

The "nature lovers" are the ones who enjoy snorkeling around for brief periods of time. They always try not to hamper with the environment. Trash is always taken care of and they do not remove shells or anything else from the ecosystem. Adventuring to experience, but not spoil, the beauty of nature under the sea.

The "pool guys" are the divers who want to go to the beach, or ocean without ever actually leaving their backyard. They come in utility vehicles (SUVs), carrying heavy-duty wet suits, and the latest in diving masks, fins, and air tanks.

They are the ones who are so covered with equipment they can hardly see, feel, and touch the underwater environment. Comparing air tanks and wet suits are what they do most.

The "seals" are the divers who act as if they are returning back to their natural habitat. Perhaps in a "previous life", they were actually seals. Diving into the water, they hardly make a splash. As soon as they are in the water, they start poking around looking for crabs, abalone and other fish. The "seals" are the people who cooks on the beach. They are also the ones, who leaves the biggest mess. However, since they use beach wood for their fires and eat what they catch in the ocean, there are no paper or plastic packaging left behind.

My family are a combination of all three types. All my brother wants to do are try out different kinds of equipment and see how deep he can dive. As for my father, he is a "seal": swimming around and cooking his 'catch' are what he enjoy most. My mother and I are "nature lovers": swimming with snorkels and fins is fun, but neither of us have any interest in diving fifty feet down or reaching under a rock to find a slimy abalone. So, we all enjoy our diving trips in our own way.
