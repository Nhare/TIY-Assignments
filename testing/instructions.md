#####Code Test
Attempt to complete the following objective in 1 hr. We will be testing the site in the latest version on Chrome for Mac OS X and Safari for iOS8.1 on an iPhone 6. Make sure you save your work to the flash drive when you are done. 

#####Objective:
Create a responsive email signup page. Use a single call to action to get users to signup for an email list using an AJAX form. Base the design of the page off of the provided logo. The form does not need to submit to a real list, but it should appear to do so when a user submits the form. 

#####Requirements:
1. Page must use the provided logo
2. Page must incorporate brand colors used within the logo. 
3. Page must be responsive

#####Suggestions: 
1. Page should be designed without the use of Photoshop, use CSS to style elements such as buttons and shadows instead of images.
2. Page should be styled using a CSS preprocessor.  
3. Page should have a fullscreen background video (video provided) that autoplays and loops.

#####Remember: 
You do not have to complete this task in 1 hour. We are more interested in how you design and what your code looks like.
