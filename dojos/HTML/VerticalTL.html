        <h3>Charlie Tango Echo</h3>
        <p>And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this
          union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and
          the bible grippers. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured
          myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession.
          It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. You know, they lay down with
          their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just look at their
          loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well,
          no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show ....
          You know? And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the
          middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get
          embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option.</p>

        <h3>Charlie November Sierra</h3>
        <p>Because you have absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you
          love with violence and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be
          questioned.  And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes
          naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I
          will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .... Because ... look at
          what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="1">
        <h3>Charlie Zulu Bravo</h3>
        <p>Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms.
          I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves
          and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="2">
        <h3>Charlie Whiskey Foxtrot</h3>
        <p>No, you won't get high .... It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit
          panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS!  They
          will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for
          the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a
          challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ...
          it just ain't there. WINNING!</p>
