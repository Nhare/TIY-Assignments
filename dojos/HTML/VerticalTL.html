            <p>
              And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and the bible grippers. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession. It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. You know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just look at their loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well, no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show .... You know? And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option.

            <p>
            Because you have absolute and total resolve about your decisions. If you love with violence and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be questioned.  And I'm ... you know ... most of the time. And this includes naps! You know, I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. And I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. And, uh .... Because ... look at what I'm dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls.

          <p>
          Yeah, why not? 'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. I'm cured. I'm done. 'Well, we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown.' Well, you don't look like you're having a lot of fun.

              No, you won't get high .... It's all good. It's all good, guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. THE BIBLE GRIPPERS!  They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING!

              And Alex, try to get your mind around this, as a fellow warrior, deep in the trenches: Their entire manifesto is built upon complete and total surrender ... or the concept of complete and total surrender.  And they're gonna fuel the battle-cry of my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers. 'Cause they're all around you .... Anyway. Thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry! WINNING! They will lose the rest of their lives as they think about me and my life for the rest of their lives. So ... it's ... there's no ... again, bring me a challenge, somebody. Bring me a frickin' challenge. Because, you know ... it just ain't there. WINNING!

          <p>
            So if you think about it, dude, it's like I'm 0-for-3 with marriage, with ne'er an excuse. And that was actually, you know, one of the few compliments that clown has paid me in frickin' almost a decade.  The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know, arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math!

            <p>
              No. She's not there now. Yeah, I sat with two - hey, coincidence - F-18, Top Gun, radical fire, napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater watching the chopper attack sequence on the beachhead to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way.  Well, yeah. But I was gonna tell you, I'm tired of being told like, 'Oh, you can't talk about that. You can't talk about that.' Bull s.h.i.t. ... uh ....
