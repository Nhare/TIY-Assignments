        <h3>What WHAT?</h3>
        <p>And you know, to sully and to contaminate or radically disrespect this
          union with a shameful contract is something I'll leave to the amateurs and
          the bible grippers. I just closed my eyes and in a nanosecond I cured
          myself from this ridiculous model of disease, addiction, and obsession.
          It's just ... It's just the work of sissies. You know, they lay down with
          their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and just look at their
          loser lives and then they look at me and say, 'I CAN'T PROCESS IT!' Well,
          no, and you never will. Stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy the show ....
          You know? And therefore there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the
          middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered. That's where you get
          embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And it's just not an option.</p>
